# 🧠 DeepChain Refinement

An advanced system that enhances prompts through chain-of-thought reasoning and multi-stage refinement processes. This project implements a sophisticated approach to generating more accurate and contextually relevant responses using progressive improvement techniques. The multi-stage architecture helps to minimize hallucinations in AI responses by cross-validating information across different processing stages.

## ✨ Features

- 🔄 **Chain-of-Thought Processing**: Implements logical reasoning chains for better understanding
- 🎯 **Multi-stage Prompting**: Uses three distinct stages of prompt refinement
- 📈 **Progressive Refinement**: Each stage builds upon and improves previous results
- 🔄 **Response Synthesis**: Combines multiple processing stages into coherent final output
- 🎯 **Integrated Intent Analysis**: Analyzes and refines user intent at each stage
- 🛡️ **Hallucination Mitigation**: Three-stage verification process helps identify and eliminate inconsistencies and hallucinations in AI responses

## 📋 Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Ollama installed and running
- gemma2:9b model
- Required Python packages (see requirements.txt)

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. Clone the repository:
```bash

## 🔧 Technical Details

### System Architecture

The system operates in three main stages:
1. 🔍 **Basic Analysis**: Initial prompt processing and response generation
2. 🔎 **Detailed Refinement**: Enhanced analysis with context consideration and fact verification
3. 🎯 **Comprehensive Synthesis**: Final stage with complete topic analysis and cross-validation
